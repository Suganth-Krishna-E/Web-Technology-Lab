            Every individual has the potential to create change, whether in their life, their community, or the world. The transformative power of education is what unlocks<br>
             that potential. Yet, access to high-quality education  has been a privilege of the few. Back in 2012, we realized it was a time for a seismic shift in learning. <br>
             From the tried and true to the leading edge. From “for some” to “for all.” By opening the classroom through online learning, edX empowers millions of learners to <br>
             unlock their potential and become changemakers.
